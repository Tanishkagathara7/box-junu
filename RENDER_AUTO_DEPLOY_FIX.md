# Render Auto-Deploy Troubleshooting Guide

## 🔍 Analysis of Your Deployment Issues

Based on your codebase analysis, here are the potential reasons why Render auto-deploy might not be working:

### ✅ **What's Correctly Configured:**

1. **Server Binding**: Your server correctly binds to `0.0.0.0:PORT` which is required for Render
2. **Health Check Endpoint**: `/api/health` endpoint is properly implemented
3. **Environment Variables**: Most required env vars are configured in `render.yaml`
4. **Node.js Version**: You're using Node.js 20.x which is current and supported
5. **Build/Start Commands**: Properly configured in `package.json`

### 🚨 **Issues Fixed:**

1. **Missing PORT Configuration**: Added `PORT: 10000` to `render.yaml`
2. **Missing Health Check Path**: Added `healthCheckPath: /api/health` to `render.yaml`

### 🔧 **Common Render Auto-Deploy Issues & Solutions:**

## Issue 1: GitHub Integration Not Enabled

**Symptoms**: Pushes to GitHub don't trigger deployments

**Solution**:
1. Go to your Render Dashboard
2. Navigate to your service (`box-host-1`)
3. Go to "Settings" tab
4. Under "Build & Deploy", ensure:
   - **Auto-Deploy** is set to "Yes"
   - **Branch** is set to "main" (or your main branch)
   - **Source** shows your GitHub repository

## Issue 2: Build Failures

**Common Causes**:
- Missing environment variables
- Node.js version conflicts
- Memory limitations on free tier
- Build timeouts

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check build logs in Render dashboard
# Look for these common errors:
- "Module not found"
- "Out of memory"
- "Build timeout"
- "npm install failed"
```

## Issue 3: Environment Variables

**Required Variables** (set these in Render Dashboard > Environment):
```
NODE_ENV=production
RENDER=true
PORT=10000
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_app_password
EMAIL_FROM=BoxCric <your_email@gmail.com>
CASHFREE_APP_ID=your_cashfree_app_id
CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY=your_cashfree_secret
FRONTEND_URL=https://boxcric.netlify.app
```

## Issue 4: Health Check Failures

**Symptoms**: Service restarts continuously, "Health check failed" in logs

**Solution**: 
- Health check endpoint must return 200-399 status
- Should respond within 5 seconds
- Your `/api/health` endpoint is correctly implemented

## Issue 5: Memory/Resource Limits

**Free Tier Limits**:
- 512 MB RAM
- 0.1 CPU
- 10-minute build timeout
- Services sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity

**Solutions**:
- Optimize bundle size
- Remove unused dependencies
- Consider upgrading to paid plan for production

## 🔄 **Manual Steps to Fix Auto-Deploy:**

### Step 1: Verify GitHub Integration
```
1. Render Dashboard → Your Service
2. Settings → Build & Deploy
3. Ensure "Auto-Deploy: Yes"
4. Ensure correct repository and branch
```

### Step 2: Check Environment Variables
```
1. Render Dashboard → Your Service
2. Environment tab
3. Verify all required variables are set
4. Especially check MONGODB_URI and JWT_SECRET
```

### Step 3: Force a Manual Deploy
```
1. Render Dashboard → Your Service  
2. Click "Manual Deploy"
3. Select "Deploy latest commit"
4. Monitor logs for errors
```

### Step 4: Check Service Logs
```
1. Render Dashboard → Your Service
2. Logs tab
3. Look for:
   - Build errors
   - Runtime errors
   - Health check failures
   - Memory issues
```

## 🚀 **Testing Your Deploy:**

After deployment, test these endpoints:
- `https://your-service.onrender.com/` (should return server info)
- `https://your-service.onrender.com/api/health` (should return health status)
- `https://your-service.onrender.com/api` (should return API info)

## 📋 **Deployment Checklist:**

- [ ] GitHub repository connected to Render
- [ ] Auto-deploy enabled
- [ ] All environment variables set
- [ ] Health check endpoint working
- [ ] Build commands correct in package.json
- [ ] render.yaml properly configured
- [ ] No critical errors in recent commits

## 🆘 **If Auto-Deploy Still Doesn't Work:**

1. **Check Render Service Status**: Sometimes Render itself has issues
2. **Contact Render Support**: Use the chat in your dashboard
3. **Try Manual Deploy**: To isolate if it's an auto-deploy specific issue
4. **Check GitHub Webhooks**: GitHub → Repo → Settings → Webhooks

## 📞 **Getting Help:**

If you continue having issues:
1. Share the Render deployment logs
2. Check if manual deployments work
3. Verify the GitHub webhook is working
4. Contact Render support with specific error messages

## Updated Files:

The following files have been updated to fix deployment issues:
- `render.yaml`: Added PORT and healthCheckPath
- `server/routes/bookings.js`: Fixed email functionality  
- `server/routes/payments.js`: Fixed email functionality

## Next Steps:

1. Commit and push these changes
2. Check Render dashboard for auto-deployment
3. Monitor deployment logs
4. Test the deployed service

Your server should now auto-deploy properly when you push to GitHub!
