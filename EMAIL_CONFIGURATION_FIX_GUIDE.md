# BoxCric Email Configuration Fix Guide

## What was fixed:

1. **Missing booking confirmation emails** - Now sends confirmation email when booking is created
2. **Missing receipt emails** - Now sends receipt email when payment is completed  
3. **Missing imports** - Added proper imports for email functions
4. **Better error handling** - Emails won't crash the booking process if they fail

## Files Modified:

### `server/routes/bookings.js`
- Added import for `sendBookingConfirmationEmail`
- Added booking confirmation email after successful booking creation
- Added proper error handling so booking doesn't fail if email fails

### `server/routes/payments.js`
- Added receipt email sending after payment verification
- Added receipt email sending in webhook handler
- Added proper error handling

## Email Configuration:

To enable email functionality, you need to set up these environment variables:

### For Gmail (Recommended):

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Gmail account
2. **Generate an App Password**:
   - Go to Google Account settings
   - Security â†’ 2-Step Verification â†’ App passwords
   - Generate password for "Mail"
3. **Add to your .env file**:

```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-16-character-app-password
EMAIL_FROM=BoxCric <your-email@gmail.com>
```

### For Other Email Providers:

```env
# Outlook/Hotmail
EMAIL_HOST=smtp-mail.outlook.com
EMAIL_PORT=587

# Yahoo
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.mail.yahoo.com
EMAIL_PORT=587

# Custom SMTP
EMAIL_HOST=your-smtp-server.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
```

## Testing the Fix:

### Method 1: Run the test script
```bash
node test-booking-email-fix.js
```

### Method 2: Test manually
1. Start your server: `npm run dev`
2. Create a new booking through the frontend
3. Complete payment
4. Check console logs for email status
5. Check your email inbox

## Expected Behavior:

### When booking is created:
- âœ… Booking confirmation email sent to user
- âœ… Console log: "ðŸ“§ Sending booking confirmation email to: user@email.com"
- âœ… Console log: "âœ… Confirmation email sent successfully! Message ID: ..."

### When payment is completed:
- âœ… Booking receipt email sent to user  
- âœ… Console log: "ðŸ“§ Sending receipt email to: user@email.com"
- âœ… Console log: "âœ… Receipt email sent successfully! Message ID: ..."

## If emails still don't work:

1. **Check console logs** for error messages
2. **Verify email configuration** in .env file
3. **Check spam/junk folder**
4. **Try with a different email provider**

## Development Mode:
If email configuration is missing, the system will run in "development mode":
- Emails are logged to console instead of being sent
- Booking process continues normally
- No actual emails are sent

## Error Handling:
- Email failures won't crash the booking process
- Errors are logged but don't prevent booking completion
- Users still get their bookings even if email fails

## Support:
If you continue having email issues:
1. Share the console logs from the server
2. Verify your email credentials are correct
3. Test with the provided test script
4. Check your email provider's SMTP settings
