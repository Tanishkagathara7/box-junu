## 🔧 **Key Technical Changes**

### **Payment Callback (`src/pages/PaymentCallback.tsx`)**
1. **Multi-source Status Detection** - checks URL params, backend, and Cashfree API
2. **Smart Status Mapping** - properly maps all Cashfree statuses to UI states
3. **Rich UI Components** - modern cards with icons and detailed information
4. **Auto-navigation** - countdown timers with manual override buttons

### **Booking Details (`src/pages/BookingDetails.tsx`)**
1. **Smart Payment Logic** - `needsPayment()` function checks multiple conditions
2. **Status-specific Messages** - different UI for each booking/payment state
3. **Enhanced Payment Badges** - icons, emojis, and transaction details
4. **Conditional Payment Button** - only shows when payment is actually needed

## 🎨 **UI Improvements**

### **Payment Callback Page:**
- ✅ **Success**: Green checkmark, booking details, auto-redirect to bookings
- ❌ **Failed**: Red X, error message, auto-redirect to home
- ⏳ **Pending**: Yellow clock, pending message, manual navigation
- ⚠️ **Error**: Alert icon, error message, manual navigation buttons

### **Booking Details Page:**
