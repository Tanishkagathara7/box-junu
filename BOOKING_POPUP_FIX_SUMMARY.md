# Booking Payment Popup Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed ‚úÖ

### 1. **Removed Annoying Payment Popup**

**Solution**:
- Added booking ID display for cancelled orders

- Clear "Order Cancelled" status with reason

### 3. **Improved Payment Status Messages**
**Problem**: Failed payments didn't show enough information

**Solution**:
- Added booking ID to failed payment messages

## Changes Made

### File: `src/pages/BookingDetails.tsx`

#### 1. Removed Auto-Opening Payment Modal
```javascript
// OLD - Auto-opened payment modal
useEffect(() => {
  if (booking && needsPayment()) {
    setIsPaymentModalOpen(true);
  }
}, [booking]);

// NEW - No auto-opening, user decides when to pay
// DO NOT auto-open payment modal - let user decide when to pay
// This prevents annoying popup every time they view booking details
```

#### 2. Enhanced Cancellation Message
```javascript
// OLD - Basic cancellation message
{booking.status === "cancelled" && (
  <div className="bg-red-50 border border-red-200 rounded-lg p-4">
    <p className="text-red-800 font-medium">‚ùå This booking has been cancelled.</p>
    {booking.cancellation?.reason && (
      <p className="text-red-600 text-sm mt-1">Reason: {booking.cancellation.reason}</p>
    )}
  </div>
)}

// NEW - Detailed cancellation with refund info
{booking.status === "cancelled" && (
  <div className="bg-red-50 border border-red-200 rounded-lg p-4 space-y-2">
    <p className="text-red-800 font-medium">‚ùå Order Cancelled</p>
    <div className="text-sm text-red-700">
      <p><strong>Booking ID:</strong> {booking.bookingId || booking._id}</p>
      {booking.cancellation?.reason && (
        <p><strong>Reason:</strong> {booking.cancellation.reason}</p>
      )}
    </div>
    {(payment.status === "completed" || payment.paidAt) && (
      <div className="bg-yellow-50 border border-yellow-200 rounded p-3 mt-2">
        <p className="text-yellow-800 text-sm">
          üí∞ <strong>Refund Information:</strong> If you paid for this booking, 
          your refund will be processed within 2-3 business days to your original payment method.
        </p>
      </div>
    )}
  </div>
)}
```

#### 3. Enhanced Failed Payment Message
```javascript
// OLD - Basic failed payment message
{payment.status === "failed" && booking.status !== "cancelled" && (
  <div className="bg-red-50 border border-red-200 rounded-lg p-4">
    <p className="text-red-800 font-medium">‚ùå Payment failed for this booking.</p>
    <p className="text-red-600 text-sm mt-1">You can try booking again or contact support.</p>
  </div>
)}

// NEW - Detailed failed payment with booking ID
{payment.status === "failed" && booking.status !== "cancelled" && (
  <div className="bg-red-50 border border-red-200 rounded-lg p-4 space-y-2">
    <p className="text-red-800 font-medium">‚ùå Payment Failed</p>
    <div className="text-sm text-red-700">
      <p><strong>Booking ID:</strong> {booking.bookingId || booking._id}</p>
      <p>Your payment could not be processed. You can try booking again or contact support.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

#### 4. Improved Payment Logic
```javascript
// Enhanced needsPayment function to prevent payment for failed payments
const needsPayment = () => {
  if (!booking) return false;

  // Only show payment if:
  // 1. Booking status is pending AND
  // 2. Payment status is pending (not failed/cancelled) AND
  // 3. Booking is not cancelled AND
  // 4. Payment hasn't failed
  return (
    booking.status === "pending" &&
    payment.status === "pending" &&
    !booking.cancellation &&
    payment.status !== "failed"
  );
};
```
