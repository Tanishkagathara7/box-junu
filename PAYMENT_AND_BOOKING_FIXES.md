# Payment and Booking Logic Fixes

## Summary of Issues Fixed

### 1. **Payment Success Logic**
**Issue**: Payment success was already correctly setting booking status to "confirmed", but the time slot availability logic was still considering pending bookings as blocking slots.

**Status**: ✅ **Already Working** - The payment verification and webhook handlers correctly set booking status to "confirmed" when payment is successful.

### 2. **Time Slot Booking Logic** 
**Issue**: Time slots were being marked as unavailable for both "pending" and "confirmed" bookings, meaning failed payments would still block slots.

**Fix Applied**:
- Modified booking availability checking to only consider confirmed bookings as unavailable
- Added logic to temporarily block slots for recent pending bookings (within 10 minutes) to prevent race conditions during payment processing
- Updated multiple endpoints:
  - `server/routes/bookings.js` - booking creation overlap check
  - `server/routes/bookings.js` - availability endpoint 
  - `server/routes/bookings.js` - admin availability endpoint
  - `admin-panel/server.js` - admin availability endpoint

### 3. **Booking Confirmation Logic**
**Issue**: Some booking confirmation flows were missing proper confirmation details (confirmation code, timestamp, etc.).

**Fix Applied**:
- Added confirmation details to ground owner approval endpoint
- Added confirmation details to admin booking creation
- Added confirmation details to admin status update endpoints
- Ensured all paths that set status to "confirmed" also set proper confirmation details

## Files Modified

### server/routes/bookings.js
- **Lines 221-235**: Updated booking overlap checking logic
- **Lines 638-644**: Updated availability endpoint to only show confirmed bookings as unavailable  
- **Lines 874-880**: Updated admin availability endpoint
- **Lines 718-725**: Added confirmation details to ground owner approval
- **Lines 1125-1131**: Added confirmation details to admin booking creation
- **Lines 1181-1198**: Added confirmation details to admin status updates

### admin-panel/server.js
- **Lines 302-308**: Updated availability checking to only consider confirmed bookings
- **Lines 395-401**: Updated overlap checking for admin booking creation
- **Lines 452-458**: Added confirmation details to admin booking creation
- **Lines 481-503**: Added confirmation details to admin status updates

## How the Fixed Logic Works

### Payment Flow
1. User creates booking → Status: "pending"
2. User pays → Payment gateway processes
3. Payment success → Webhook/verification sets status to "confirmed" + confirmation details
4. Payment failure → Status set to "cancelled"

### Time Slot Availability
1. **For Users**: Only "confirmed" bookings show as unavailable
2. **During Booking**: Recent pending bookings (< 10 min) temporarily block slots to prevent double booking
3. **Failed Payments**: Cancelled bookings don't block slots
4. **Expired Bookings**: Cleanup job cancels old pending bookings

### Confirmation Details
All confirmed bookings now have:
- `confirmedAt`: Timestamp when confirmed
- `confirmationCode`: Unique code (e.g., "BC123456")  
- `confirmedBy`: Who confirmed ("system", "admin", "ground_owner")

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Payment Success Flow
1. Create a booking
2. Complete payment successfully
3. Verify booking status changes to "confirmed"
4. Verify confirmation details are set
5. Verify time slot shows as booked for other users

### 2. Test Payment Failure Flow  
1. Create a booking
2. Let payment fail or expire
3. Verify booking status changes to "cancelled"
4. Verify time slot becomes available again

### 3. Test Time Slot Availability
1. Create booking A for time slot 10:00-11:00
2. While A is pending, try to book same slot → Should be blocked temporarily
3. After A payment fails, try to book same slot → Should be available
4. After A payment succeeds, try to book same slot → Should be blocked permanently

### 4. Test Admin/Owner Confirmation
1. Create booking with pending status
2. Admin/owner confirms booking
3. Verify confirmation details are properly set
4. Verify time slot shows as booked

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

✅ **Payment Success**: Booking immediately confirmed, time slot blocked
✅ **Payment Failure**: Booking cancelled, time slot available  
✅ **Time Slots**: Only confirmed bookings block availability
✅ **Race Conditions**: Prevented by temporary blocking during payment
✅ **Confirmation Codes**: Generated for all confirmation methods
✅ **Admin Override**: Can override pending bookings if needed
